## HelpMe product context (always apply)

### Purpose
HelpMe is a **bio-adaptive performance manager**: it synchronizes a user’s tasks with their biological reality to protect deep focus, prevent burnout, and improve follow-through.

### Core philosophy
- **Energy is a currency**: every plan must respect today’s recovery and capacity.
- **Human-first**: the user is always in control; the AI suggests and explains.
- **Explainability**: any prioritization/scheduling output must include “why”.

### Core concepts (vocabulary)
- **Bio-Calibration**: the morning check-in ritual.
- **EnergyBudget**: the day’s available capacity derived from recovery signals.
- **CurrentCapacity**: remaining capacity after work is done.
- **CapacityState**: user feedback loop that adjusts depletion rate:
  - `Fresh` / `Tired` / `Taxed`
- **TaskIntensity**:
  - `DeepFocus` (high drain)
  - `Routine` (medium)
  - `QuickWin` (low)

### Key workflows / rituals
- **Morning check-in (Bio-Calibration)**:
  - user logs sleep/rest quality (1–10) and optional notes
  - set `EnergyBudget` for today
- **Dynamic capacity tracking**:
  - tasks deplete `CurrentCapacity` based on intensity
  - `CapacityState` can change depletion (user feedback loop)
- **Evening reflection**:
  - summarize today and capture “how it went”
- **Tomorrow prediction**:
  - AI predicts tomorrow’s baseline energy from trends and reflections

### Product rules (how features should behave)
- Always show **reasoning** for priorities:
  - energy fit, urgency, impact, and intensity distribution
- Prefer sustainable scheduling:
  - avoid stacking many `DeepFocus` tasks in one day
  - spread high-intensity tasks across the week (Weekly Plan)
- Avoid “100% energy assumed” UX:
  - always allow a low-energy fallback plan (“minimum viable day”)

### Page architecture (intent + recommended routes)
- Today (Dashboard): `app/(app)/today`
  - morning check-in card
  - active task list with timers
  - evening reflection hook
- WeeklyPlan (Strategic Horizon): `app/(app)/weekly`
  - distribute intensity across 7 days
  - smart schedule suggestions
- BioTrends (Analytics): `app/(app)/trends`
  - rest vs output correlation
  - average deep focus hours
- MasterList (Archive): `app/(app)/tasks`
  - all objectives (pending + completed)
- Calibration (Profile): `app/(app)/calibration`
  - chronotype (peak focus hours) and working window
