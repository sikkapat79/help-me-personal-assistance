## DB (Neon Postgres + TypeORM) conventions

### Persistence style (Repository pattern)
- Use **Repository** pattern for data access.
- Do **not** use Active Record patterns (entities don't have `save()`/`remove()` methods).
- Persistence happens via repositories obtained from `getRepository()` inside `lib/features/<feature>/use-cases/**`.

### Where DB code lives
- ORM bootstrap + helpers: `lib/db/**` (typeorm-config.ts, connection.ts)
- Entities: `lib/db/entities/**`
- Migrations: `lib/db/migrations/**`

### Rules of thumb
- Do not access the DB directly from UI components.
- Prefer per-feature repositories/use-cases rather than scattering queries everywhere.
- Always use parameterized queries via TypeORM's query builder or repository methods.

### Entities
- Entities may include **pure** domain methods (no DB calls, no network calls, no repository access).
- Entity constructors should be optional - TypeORM instantiates entities without calling constructors when loading from DB.
- Use definite assignment assertion (`!`) for entity fields that TypeORM will initialize.
- Keep entities focused; put orchestration and persistence logic in use-cases.

### Column mapping
- Use snake_case in database (e.g., `display_name`, `created_at`)
- Use camelCase in entities (e.g., `displayName`, `createdAt`)
- Map columns explicitly: `@Column({ name: 'display_name' })`

### TypeORM patterns
- Get repositories: `const repo = await getRepository(Entity)`
- Find one: `await repo.findOne({ where: { id }, relations: ['relation'] })`
- Find many: `await repo.find({ where: { ... }, order: { field: 'ASC' } })`
- Save: `await repo.save(entity)` (works for both insert and update)
- Use `Not()`, `LessThan()`, `MoreThan()` operators from TypeORM for complex queries

### Migrations
- Generate migrations: `pnpm db:migration:generate -- lib/db/migrations/MigrationName`
- Run migrations: `pnpm db:migrate:run`
- Migrations are applied via scripts, not during normal requests.
- Keep migrations reviewable; avoid "magic schema sync" in production.

### Connections (serverless)
- DataSource singleton with connection pooling (max: 20, min: 5) configured in `typeorm-config.ts`.
- Connection automatically reused across requests.
- Use `withTransaction()` helper for explicit transactions.
- Keep transactions short and explicit when used.
