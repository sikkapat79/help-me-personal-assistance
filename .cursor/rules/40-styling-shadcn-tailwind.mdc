## Styling (Tailwind + shadcn/ui)

### Component placement
- shadcn/ui primitives live in `components/ui/**`.
- App-specific components live in `components/**` (compose primitives).
- Page-scoped components can be colocated under `app/**/_components/**` when truly route-specific.

### Styling rules
- Prefer Tailwind utility classes; keep `app/globals.css` for tokens/base styles only.
- Use a `cn(...)` helper (in `lib/utils`) for conditional className composition.
- Keep UI components presentational; move business logic to Server Actions and `lib/*`.

### Component ID convention (REQUIRED)
- **All React components MUST have an `id` attribute on their root element**.
- Naming convention: **kebab-case** derived from component name
  - `TaskCreateModal` → `id="task-create-modal"`
  - `SubmitButton` → `id="submit-button"`
- For interactive elements (buttons, inputs, forms), also add descriptive IDs
  - Example: `<Button id="add-task-button">`
- Purpose: DOM targeting, CSS selectors, debugging, analytics tracking
